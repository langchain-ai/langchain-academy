    "To create a [self-hosted deployment](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/deploy-self-hosted/#how-to-do-a-self-hosted-deployment-of-langgraph), we'll follow a few steps. \n",

    "\n",
    "### Set Up Redis and PostgreSQL\n",
    "\n",
    "If you already have Redis and PostgreSQL running (e.g., locally or on other servers), then create and run the LangGraph Server container [by itself](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/deploy-self-hosted/#running-the-application-locally) with the URIs for Redis and PostgreSQL:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can use the provided `docker-compose.yml` file to create three separate containers based on the services defined: \n",
    "\n",
    "* `langgraph-redis`: Creates a new container using the official Redis image.\n",
    "* `langgraph-postgres`: Creates a new container using the official Postgres image.\n",
    "* `langgraph-api`: Creates a new container using your pre-built image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply copy the `docker-compose-example.yml` and add the following environment variables to run the deployed `task_maistro` app:\n",

    "* `LANGSMITH_API_KEY`\n",
